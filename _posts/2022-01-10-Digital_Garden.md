This is my first post and I decided to start it while learning "how to", and creating this site.
I wanted to start as fast as possible since I want to avoid goint to much into the creation of the site and to later "forget" the true reason to start this project.

After some research I decided to start with Jekyll, a tool to simplify the creation of static websites and blogs, and to host it with GitHub Pages since I already have previous knowledge of it. 

I am now following the step-by-step guide availabe in the jekyllrb.com website.
